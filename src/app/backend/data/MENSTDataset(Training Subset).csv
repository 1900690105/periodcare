1,F1,Does period pain affect fertility?,"No, period pain does not affect fertility. A painful period is usually a period where ovulation has occurred. If pain is due to endometriosis, it is usually chronic and is not easily alleviated by painkillers. If the endometriosis is advanced, it may block the fallopian tubes and cause infertility.",All,Both,"Pain, Fertility, Doctor",None

1,F2,What is menstruation? What is the menstrual cycle?,"Menstruation is the process in which the uterus sheds blood and tissue through the vagina. This is a natural and healthy process for girls and women of reproductive age. In Western communities, this is often called “the period.” It typically lasts 2 to 5 days, but this varies by individual. When a person begins to menstruate, this is called menarche. The age of menarche varies by individual. Menstruation is part of the menstrual cycle – a cycle of biological changes that take place in a woman or girl’s reproductive system to prepare her body for a potential pregnancy. The changes are triggered by hormones, which are natural chemicals in the body. This cycle begins when a girl reaches puberty and continues until she reaches the end of her fertility (also known as menopause, at which time menstrual cycles end). The menstrual cycle is roughly 28 days long, but it can be shorter or longer. It begins with menstruation (considered day 1 of the cycle). Menstruation is the shedding of the lining of the uterus and the remnants of the unfertilized egg. It continues with an increase in the hormone estrogen, and the lining of the uterus becomes thick and spongy again (typically days 6-8). An egg is released from one of the ovaries, called “ovulation” (around day 14, but this can vary), then the egg moves through the fallopian tube towards the uterus (typically day 15- 24). If the egg is not fertilized, it will not be implanted in the uterine wall but instead fall apart, and hormone levels such as estrogen and progesterone, will drop. This process is followed by the start of a new cycle. While a person’s menstrual cycles may be consistent – even predictable– they can also change or vary, particularly in the first few years after menarche. Some changes, such as absence of bleeding, signal a pregnancy. Other changes can be related to contraceptive use, stress, nutrition, physical activity or health concerns. Some cycle changes are just a natural part of ageing.",All,Both,"Basics, Education",None
1,F2,How is menstruation related to human rights?,"Human rights are rights that every human being has by virtue of his or her human dignity. Menstruation is intrinsically related to human dignity– when people cannot access safe bathing facilities and safe and One of these factors is the perception that menstruation is dirty or shameful. This view contributes to restrictions women and girls face during vaginal bleeding, which exist in many, if not most, countries. Some restrictions are cultural, such as prohibitions on handling food or entering religious spaces, or the requirement that women and girls isolate themselves. (See examples of menstruation taboos and discrimination here.) Some restrictions are self-imposed; women or girls may fear participating in activities like school, athletics or social gatherings. Together, these practices can reinforce the idea that women and girls have less claim to public spaces, and that they are less able to participate in public life. Barriers to opportunities: Another common misconception is that women and girls have diminished capacities, whether physical or emotional, due to their menstrual cycles. These ideas can create barriers to opportunities, reinforcing gender inequality. In truth, most women and girls do not have their abilities hindered in any way by menstruation. Barriers to sanitation and health: Poverty and humanitarian crises can limit women’s and girls’ access to culturally appropriate, high quality menstrual supplies and safe, private washing facilities. Vulnerable women and girls in middle- and high-income countries can also face poor access to safe bathing facilities and menstrual supplies –including those in impoverished school systems, prisons and homeless shelters. Heightened vulnerability: The onset of menstruation, called menarche, can undermine girls’ human rights. In many places around the world, menarche is believed to be an indication that girls are ready for marriage or sexual activity. This leaves girls vulnerable to a host of abuses, including child marriage and sexual violence. Deeply impoverished girls have been known to engage in transactional sex to afford menstrual products.",All,Both,"Awareness, Rights",None
1,F2,What do people need to manage their menstruation?,"Health issues particular to women’s and girls’ bodies – including not only menstruation but also pregnancy, childbirth, post-partum changes and menopause – have often been overlooked by decision-makers, policymakers, educators and even medical establishment. As a result, women and girls often know little about the changes they will experience as they advance through life. Many girls learn about menstruation only when they reach puberty, which can be a frightening and confusing experience. People of different gender diversities, as well, such as transgender men and nonbinary people, often face additional barriers to information and supplies to safely manage menstruation, including possible threats to their safety and well-being. In the last few years, however, menstrual health and hygiene management have become topics of conversation among girls’ advocates, education experts, humanitarian professionals, human rights and global development specialists. There is now wide agreement about what is required during menstruation: - They must have safe access to clean material to absorb or collect menstrual blood, and these items must be acceptable to the individuals who need them. - They must be able to change these materials in safety and privacy, and have a place to dispose of used menstrual supplies or to wash reusable supplies. - Menstruating people must also be able to safely and privately wash with soap and water. - They should have basic education about the menstrual cycle and how to manage menstruation without discomfort or fear. - People who menstruate should also have access to health information and care, ensuring they are able to make informed choices about how to manage their menstruation, and enabling them to seek care if they experience menstruation-related disorders. Menstrual products must also be safe, effective and acceptable to the people who use them. These products may include: Disposable menstrual pads (also commonly called sanitary napkins or sanitary towels), reusable menstrual pads, tampons, menstrual cups, and clean, absorbent fabrics such as cloths or period underwear.",All,Both,"Products, Hygiene, Education",None
1,F2,What happens when menstruation cannot be managed properly?,"Lack of access to the right menstrual products may lead to greater risk of infection. For example, some studies show that, in locations with high humidity, reusable pads may not dry thoroughly, possibly contributing to infection risks. Other products, such as menstrual cups, require sterilization and tampons require frequent changing, both of which may present challenges in conditions like humanitarian crises. In some cases, women and girls do not have access to menstrual products at all. They may resort to rags, leaves, newspaper or other makeshift items to absorb or collect menstrual blood. They may also be prone to leaks, contributing to shame or embarrassment.  One study has suggested that there may be an increased risk of urogenital infections, such as yeast infection, vaginosis or urinary tract infections, when women and girls are not able to bathe and/or change or clean their menstrual supplies regularly. However, there is no clear causal relationship, and urogenital infections are more often caused by internal, than external bacteria. Women and girls living in extreme poverty and in humanitarian crises may be more likely to face these challenges. In one Syrian refugee community, for example, health workers reported seeing high levels of such vaginal infections, perhaps a result of poor menstrual hygiene management. However, there is no strong evidence about the risks and prevalence of such infections. Cultural expectations and beliefs can also play a role. Some traditions discourage menstruating people from touching or washing their genitals during menstruation, which might increase their vulnerability to infection and discomfort, and could affect their sense of dignity.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Health, Access",None
1,F2,What are symptoms or disorders related to menstruation?,"Menstruation is often different from person to person, and even one person can experience very different periods over their lifetime. This is often healthy and normal. But when menstruation prevents people from engaging in regular activities, medical attention is required. Unfortunately, lack of attention to, and education about, menstruation means that many women and girls suffer for years without receiving care. Below are some of the conditions and disorders related to menstruation.  One common menstruation-related complaint is dysmenorrhea, also known as menstrual cramps or painful periods. It often presents as pelvic, abdominal or back pain. In some cases, this pain can be debilitating. Studies show that dysmenorrhea is a major gynaecological issue among people around the world, contributing to absenteeism from school and work, as well as diminished quality of life. Sometimes, menstrual irregularities can indicate serious disorders. For example, some women and girls may experience abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding, called menorrhagia, which could signal a hormonal imbalance or other concerns.  Excruciating pain or excessive bleeding during menstruation can also indicate reproductive problems such as endometriosis (when the uterine lining grows outside of the uterus) or fibroids (lumpy growths in the uterus). Irregular, infrequent or prolonged periods can indicate disorders such as polycystic ovary syndrome. Extremely heavy periods can also increase the risk of iron-deficiency anaemia, which can cause extreme fatigue, weakness, dizziness and other symptoms. Severe or chronic iron-deficiency anaemia can cause dangerous complications during pregnancy as well as physiological problems. The hormonal changes associated with the menstrual cycle can also cause physical and emotional symptoms, ranging from soreness, headaches and muscle pain to anxiety and depression. These symptoms are sometimes considered premenstrual syndrome (PMS), but when severe or disabling they are sometimes considered premenstrual dysphoric disorder. There are also conditions that can exacerbate menstruation-related complaints. For example, studies show that female genital mutilation can cause longer and more painful periods.",All,Both,"Disorders, Doctor, Symptoms",None
1,F2,What is PMS and when does it occur?,"Most people who menstruate experience some physical or emotional discomfort known as premenstrual syndrome (PMS) about a week before or during the first few days of their menstrual periods. PMS manifests differently in different people and may vary between menstruation cycles. The most common symptoms during PMS include changes in appetite, backaches, acne, bloating, headaches, depression, feelings of sadness, tension or anxiety, irritability, sweating, tender breasts, water retention, constipation or diarrhea, trouble concentrating, insomnia and tiredness. For some, these symptoms can be so severe that they miss work or school, while others are not bothered. On average, women in their 30s are most likely to have PMS. PMS may also increase as a person approaches menopause because of the fluctuations in hormone levels. It is not really known why people experience PMS. Researchers believe it is because of the dramatic drop in estrogen and progesterone that takes place after ovulation when a woman is not pregnant. PMS symptoms often disappear when the hormone levels begin to rise again. About half of women who need relief from PMS also have another health problem, such as depression or anxiety disorders, myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel syndrome, and bladder pain syndrome. Stereotypes and stigma surrounding PMS can contribute to discrimination. For instance, people may assume that PMS affects all women, or that it undermines women’s competence in the school or workplace.",All,Both,"Symptoms, Mood",None
1,F2,When does menstruation start? Is the onset of menstruation earlier today than it used to be?,"The onset of menstruation, called menarche, varies from person to person. It commonly starts between the ages of 10 and 16. In rare cases, menarche can take place before a girl reaches age 7 or 8. Menarche can also be delayed or prevented due to malnutrition, excessive exercise or medical issues. It is hard to know the global average age of menarche, because recent and comparable data are hard to find. One study from 1998 found that 14 is a typical age of menarche. Some studies have found that menarche is occurring earlier among girls in certain places, often in high-income countries and communities. Research from countries such as South Africa suggest these changes are related to nutrition and socio-economic status, meaning that as nutrition and health improve, girls’ bodies may mature slightly earlier. However, lack of systematically collected data from low-income countries means that broader or global conclusions cannot be made. Similarly, it is difficult to determine the average age at which menstruation ends, known as menopause. Data from 1999 suggest an average age of around 50.",Adolescents,Both,"Education, Age, Trends",None
1,F2,What are common myths and taboos about menstruation? How do they affect the status of women?,"Menstrual taboos have existed, and still exist, in many or most cultures. Around the world and throughout history, misconceptions about menstruation have led to women’s and girls’ exclusion from all kinds of  roles and settings – everything from leadership positions to space travel. Below is a non-exhaustive list of menstruation myths and taboos, as well as their impact on women and girls. Myth: Menstruation is dirty or dangerous Menstrual blood is composed of regular blood and tissue, with no special or dangerous properties. Yet throughout history, many communities have thought the mere presence of menstruating women could cause harm to plants, food and livestock. In the 1930s, Western scientists hypothesized that menstruating women’s bodies produced “menotoxins,” a kind of poison. People continue to hold similar beliefs today. Some communities believe women and girls can spread misfortune or impurity during menstruation (or other vaginal bleeding). As a result, they may face restrictions on their day-to-day behavior, including prohibitions on attending religious ceremonies, visiting religious spaces, handling food or sleeping in the home. In western Nepal, the tradition of chhaupadi prohibits women and girls from cooking food and compels them to spend the night outside the home, often in a hut or livestock shed. Similar rules apply to women and girls in parts of India and other countries. (In one rural community in Ethiopia, the taboos about vaginal bleeding led not only to women and girls being exiled from the home during menstruation, but also during childbirth and postpartum bleeding.) Isolation and expulsion from the home are often dangerous for women and girls – and can even be fatal. For example, women and girls in Nepal have been exposed to extreme cold, animal attacks or even sexual violence. (It is important to note that not all aspects of these traditions are negative. In some places, limitations on women’s and girls’ activities give them an opportunity to return their maternal home to relax. See more here.) Menstrual stigmas also affect how women and girls are able to manage their health and hygiene. Some cultures prohibit women and girls from touching or washing their genitals during menstruation, possibly contributing to infections. In some parts of Afghanistan, it is even believed that washing the body during menstruation can lead to infertility. In other places, women and girls are fearful that their bodies could pollute water sources or toilets.  These beliefs also affect how women and girls dispose of menstrual products. In some places, women burn menstrual pads to avoid cursing animals or nature. In other places, burning menstrual products is believed to cause infertility. Some communities believe menstrual products should be buried to avoid attracting evil spirits. Others believe improper disposal of these products can cause a girl to menstruate continuously for life. Myth: Certain foods are off-limits to menstruating women and girls Many communities believe menstruating women and girls cannot eat certain foods, such as sour or cold foods, or those prone to spoilage. In fact, there are no medically recommended restrictions on the kinds of food menstruating people can or should eat, and dietary restrictions can actually put them at risk by limiting their nutrient intake. Myth: Menstruation indicates readiness for marriage and sex In many places around the world, a girl’s first period, called menarche, is believed to be a sign that she is ready for marriage, sexual activity and childbirth. This leaves girls vulnerable to a host of abuses, including child marriage, sexual violence or coercion, and early pregnancy. While menstruation is one indication of biological fertility, it does not mean girls have reached mental, emotional, psychological or physical maturity. In rare cases, menarche can take place before a girl reaches age 7 or 8, for example. And even older teens may not be mature enough to make informed choices about marriage, sexual activity or motherhood. Myth: Menstruation limits women’s abilities Menstruation is also commonly believed to limit women’s physical or mental abilities. Nineteenth century physicians, for example, believed that periods “render it extremely doubtful how far they can be considered responsible beings.” Similar ideas persist today. Women may face degrading comments about menstruation affecting their physical or emotional states. They may be excluded from certain roles or positions of leadership. Myth: Real women menstruate Women can also face stigma and mistreatment for not having periods. Those who do not menstruate may be disparaged as “not real women.” Such perceptions contribute to some women’s reluctance to use  contraceptive methods that affect their menstrual cycles. These beliefs can adversely affect women who do not experience regular monthly menstruation, such as women who have irregular cycles and transgender women. These ideas are also harmful to transgender men who menstruate. These men can face discrimination, limited access to menstruation products and poor access to safe, private washing facilities. Taboo: Menstruation should not be discussed publicly Silence about menstruation can lead to ignorance and neglect, including at the policy level. This leaves women and girls vulnerable to things like period poverty and discrimination. It also adversely affects women and girls with heightened vulnerabilities. Those living with HIV can face stigma when seeking sanitation facilities, menstruation supplies and health care, for example. Those in prisons or other forms of detention may be deprived of menstruation supplies. Myth: All women are moody when they menstruate The menstrual cycle is driven by hormonal changes. These have different effects on different people. In some women, moodiness is a side-effect of these hormonal changes. Other women do not experience mood changes. Myth: Menstruation is a women’s issue only While it is true that menstruation is experienced in the bodies of women and girls – as well as other individuals such as non-binary and trans persons – menstrual health issues are human rights issues, and therefore of importance to society as a whole. This means that men and boys must be involved in conversations about gender equality and  promoting positive masculinities aiming to eliminate menstruation- associated stigma and discrimination.",All,Both,"Awareness, Taboos, Gender Equality",None
1,F2,What is period poverty?,"Period poverty describes the struggle many low-income women and girls face while trying to afford menstrual products. The term also refers to the increased economic vulnerability women and girls face due the financial burden posed by menstrual supplies. These include not only menstrual pads and tampons, but also related costs such as pain medication and underwear.  Period poverty does not only affect women and girls in developing countries; it also affects women in wealthy, industrialized countries. Difficulty affording menstrual products can cause girls to stay home from school and work, with lasting consequences on their education and economic opportunities. It can also exacerbate existing vulnerabilities, pushing women and girls closer toward dangerous coping mechanisms. Studies in Kenya, for example, have shown that some schoolgirls have engaged in transactional sex to pay for menstrual products. Period poverty is not only an economic issue, but a social and political one as well. For instance, some advocates have called for menstruation products to be taxation exempt. Such efforts in India have resulted in the elimination of tax on menstrual pads and tampons.",All,Both,"Access, Products",None
1,F2,What are positive aspects of menstruation?,"Regular menstruation can be an indication that a woman’s reproductive health is on track.  It can help women understand and, in a general way, monitor their fertility. For instance, many women regard their monthly period as an indication that they are not pregnant. (This method is not foolproof, however, since even pregnant women can experience bleeding, such as implantation bleeding). Some traditions offer menstruating women and girls a chance to bond with one another. In Rajasthan, India, where menstruation can restrict women’s and girls’ activities, recently married women may use it as an opportunity to visit their maternal families. Menstruation can also be an opportunity to take a break from regular responsibilities. One girl in Rajasthan, Poonam, told UNFPA that she is happy that she is not expected to help out with household chores when she is menstruating.",All,Both,"Education, Awareness",None
1,F2,Does menstruation limit what people can do?,"No. While menstruation has been used throughout history to exclude women and girls from all kinds of roles and settings, there is really nothing that menstruating people cannot do. Exercise, swimming,  bathing, work and sex are all possible during menstruation. In some cultures, there are restrictions on what people can do during menstruation, but these are customs, beliefs and traditions and have nothing to do with people’s actual abilities. Menstruating women can – and have – competed in the Olympics, run marathons, traveled to space, held leadership roles, served as judges and held religious offices. However, the management of menstruation does influence what people can do; women and girls may prefer to go swimming when they have access to menstrual cups or tampons, for instance. Menstrual symptoms can also affect what people feel like doing.",All,Both,"Limitations, Awareness",None
1,F2,What is UNFPA doing on the issue of menstrual health?,"UNFPA has four broad approaches to promoting and improving menstrual health around the world.  First, UNFPA reaches women and girls directly with menstrual supplies and safe sanitation facilities. In humanitarian emergencies, for example, UNFPA distributes dignity kits, which contain disposable and reusable menstrual pads, underwear, soap and related items. (In 2017, 484,000 dignity kits were distributed in 18 countries.) UNFPA also helps to improve the safety of toilets and bathing facilities in displacement camps by working with camp officials, distributing flashlights and installing solar lights. UNFPA also promotes menstrual health information and skills-building. For example, some UNFPA programmes teach girls to make reusable menstrual pads. Others raise awareness about menstrual cups. Second, UNFPA works to improve education and information about menstruation and related human rights concerns. Through its youth programmes and comprehensive sexuality education efforts, such as the Y-Peer programme, UNFPA helps both boys and girls understand that menstruation is healthy and normal. UNFPA also help raise awareness that the onset of menstruation (menarche) does not signify a physical or  psychological readiness to be married or bear children. The UNFPA- UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage,  for instance, teaches girls and communities about reproductive health and the harms caused by child marriage. Programmes to end female  UNFPA distributes menstrual management supplies during humanitarian emergencies, often in packages of supplies called dignity kits. © UNFPA Syria/Sufian Abdulmouty genital mutilation, including the UNFPA-UNICEF Joint Programme to Eliminate FGM, raise awareness of the negative consequences the practice can have on menstrual health. Third, UNFPA supports national health systems, which can promote menstrual health and provide treatment to girls and women suffering from menstrual disorders. This includes promoting adolescent- and youth-friendly health services, which can help girls and young women better understand and care for their bodies. UNFPA also supports the hiring and training of health workers, particularly midwives, who can provide care for, and information about, menstrual health complaints. UNFPA also procures reproductive health commodities that can be useful for treating menstruation-related disorders. For instance, hormonal contraceptive methods can be used to treat symptoms of endometriosis and reduce excess menstrual bleeding. Last, UNFPA is helping to gather data and evidence about menstrual health and its connection to global development – a long overlooked topic of research. For instance, UNFPA-supported surveys provide critical insight into girls’ and women’s knowledge about their menstrual cycles, health and access to sanitation facilities. And a recent UNFPA publication provides a critical overview of the menstrual health needs of women and girls in the Eastern and Southern Africa region.",All,Both,"Awareness, Advocacy",None
1,F2,Can a person get pregnant during menstruation?,"Yes. It is widely believed that intercourse during menstruation cannot result in pregnancy. However, this is not true for women and girls with shorter or irregular menstrual cycles. Non-menstrual vaginal bleeding may also be mistaken for menstruation, which can convey a false sense of security against pregnancy. The only reliable way to prevent pregnancy is to use a modern form of contraception.",All,Both,"Fertility, Education",None
1,F2,Is menstruation bad for the environment?,"No, menstruation in itself is not bad for the environment. However, products used to manage menstruation can have a negative impact on the environment, depending on the product and the way it is disposed. Menstrual products such as tampons and pads often contain plastics and chemicals that are bad for the environment. The time it takes for them to degrade in a landfill is centuries longer than the lifespan of a woman. Menstrual products can also be found in bodies of water and along shorelines. The manufacturing process to produce menstrual products also has environmental consequences. More environmentally friendly options include reusable menstrual cups as well as reusable and/or biodegradable pads. But in many places, alternative methods are not available or culturally acceptable. In all circumstances, the choice of menstrual product must be acceptable to the people using them. For example, some women are not comfortable with insertable products like menstrual cups. In humid environments, reusable menstrual pads may be difficult to thoroughly dry. Given the potential environmental consequences of disposable menstrual products, it is important to expand the range of methods available to women, allowing them to make informed choices that fit their needs.",All,Both,"Environment, Products",None
1,F2,Are menstrual products bad for your health?,"In general, no. However, there are possible health impacts to consider.  Use of highly absorbent tampons has been associated with toxic shock syndrome (TSS), a life-threatening condition, but these cases are rare. Frequently changing tampons greatly lowers the risk of TSS. People with sensitive skin may have reactions to the materials used in menstrual products, such as the fragrances used in some pads. In addition, many countries do not obligate manufacturers to disclose the ingredients or components of menstrual products, which could lead to women being exposed to unwanted materials. Some tampon brands, for instance, contain chemicals like dioxins. There has been little research to determine the health consequences, if any, caused by exposure to these chemicals.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Safety, Products",None
1,F2,How will the COVID-19 pandemic affect people's ability to manage their menstruation?,"Communities around the world are feeling the numerous and overlapping effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. These may have significant impacts on some people's ability to manage their menstruation safely and with dignity: Gaps in provision of water and sanitation services, such as lack of sewage maintenance or disruption of water supply, will have a direct impact on people's ability to manage their menstruation. Stock-outs and supply chain disruptions mean that communities could lose access to menstrual pads, tampons and other menstrual materials. People who may be quarantined because they have either contracted or come into contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19 may have limited access to menstrual products or running water. Financial stress on families who may be underemployed due to the pandemic may lead to households prioritizing other basic needs like food or household bills over menstruation supplies. Increased prices of menstrual health supplies due to increased demand, panic-buying or disrupted supply chains may leave some without supplies, or without the supplies of their choice. Lack of knowledge of one's own menstruation and menarche may contribute to stress and anxiety. The pandemic may limit access to  critical information related to menstrual health due to disruption of regular health services, school closures, limited access to technology and suspension of community-based programming. In times of global crises, such as this pandemic, it is critical to ensure that menstruating people continue to have access to the facilities, products and information they need to protect their dignity, health and well-being. Decision-makers must assure these essential menstrual health items remain available.",All,Both,"Access, Health, COVID-19",None
1,F3,How can I keep track of my menstrual cycle?,"Use a calendar to keep track of your menstrual cycle. You can mark each day of your period with an ""X."" Calculate the length of your cycle by counting the days from the first day of bleeding in one period to the first day of bleeding in the next period. In addition to noting the days of your period, it is helpful to make notes about the flow, any pain that is felt, and changes in mood or behavior.

1,F3,Can menstrual irregularities lead to other health problems?,"The presence of menstrual irregularities can be a sign of other health problems such as thyroid disease, POI, endometriosis, PCOS, polyps, and uterine fibroids. If left untreated, menstrual irregularities can lead to or contribute to other conditions. These possible conditions vary depending on the type of menstrual irregularity, but some include thickening of the lining of  the uterus (called endometrial hyperplasia), low bone density, and iron- deficient anemia.

1,F3,When should I see my health care provider about menstrual irregularities?,"It is important to contact your health care provider promptly about any significant changes in your menstrual cycle. It is also important to contact your provider if your cycles are associated with significant bleeding or pain, even if your cycle has always been that way. The presence of menstrual irregularities can be indicative of other health problems, such as POI, endometriosis, PCOS, polyps, or uterine fibroids. Your health care provider can order the appropriate tests to diagnose the cause of the menstrual irregularity and provide appropriate treatment.",All,Both,"Health, Diagnosis, Doctor",None
1,F3,Can menstrual irregularities lead to cancer?,"Menstrual irregularities are often a sign of an underlying condition and, in some cases, the underlying condition may be associated with a higher risk for cancer. For example, absent and irregular periods associated with estrogen production but no progesterone production are associated with endometrial cancer in about 14% of women, if the problem is recurrent. Women who experience irregular periods on a frequent basis may also have a higher risk of ovarian cancer after age 70.

1,F6,What's A Normal Cycle Length and What if the Length of My Cycle Varies?,"A woman's menstrual cycle is often thought to be 28 days, but that's just an average. Clinically, a normal cycle ranges from 21 to 35 days, and for young teens, it can span 21 to 45 days. While some women experience extremely regular periods, it's normal for cycle lengths to vary slightly from month to month. In fact, a gynecologist would only consider a cycle abnormal if its length varied by 20 days or more. Lifestyle factors such as stress, changes in exercise routines, dieting, weight fluctuations, or illness can all impact the length of a cycle. So, if your period is later than usual, consider recent events in your life—like having the flu—as a possible explanation, which can provide peace of mind.",All,Both,"Cycle, Length, Variations",None
1,F6,Are My Cramps Normal? When Should I Tell My Doctor?,"According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, a surprising 90% of women are thought to suffer from a condition called dysmenorrhea, more commonly known as ""the cramps."" Along with debilitating cramping, women may also experience nausea or vomiting, headache and diarrhea for up to the first three days of a period. Period pain can be especially bad for young women during the first few years of their period. Usually dysmenorrhea is considered ""normal"" because it's not caused by any underlying health condition. Even so, treatments (such as Ibuprofen or other NSAIDs and hormonal birth control) are available. Secondary dysmenorrhea is period pain caused by health conditions, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, fibroids or endometriosis. Your gynecologist will need to treat the underlying condition to truly relieve your symptoms.",All,Both,"Cramps, Pain, Doctor",None

1,F7,Why do we get periods every month?,"Periods, or menstruation, are the cyclical bleeding from the uterus that occurs about every month or so, and are a part of the normal menstrual cycle. The changes in hormone levels, as well as in the ovaries and uterus, that happen during a menstrual cycle are all aimed at achieving pregnancy. When pregnancy doesn’t occur, the uterus sheds its inner lining along with blood and mucus through the cervix and vagina due to a sharp decrease in estrogen and progesterone.",All,Both,"Basics, Education",None
1,F7,How long without a period is normal?,"Menstrual cycles that are 21–35 days long are considered normal. A period is considered late if it’s more than five days past its expected start date. Sometimes a period delay can be due to stress or rapid weight loss. More rarely, it may be a sign of an endocrine condition like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), thyroid dysfunction, hyperprolactinemia, or another health issue.

1,F7,Can I get pregnant from sex two days before my period starts?,"Pregnancy is possible on any day of the cycle, but the chances are higher during the fertile window. Ovulation is when the egg is released from the ovary, and it normally happens 10 to 16 days before the next period starts. Taking into account that an egg cannot live for more than 24 hours, and sperm can survive for up to five days, the days with the highest chances of conception are five days before ovulation and 24 hours after it.",Young Adults,Both,"Fertility, Education",None
1,F7,Is it normal to get emotional before a period?,"The period after ovulation and before menstruation is called the luteal phase. During this phase, the body is getting ready for pregnancy in case fertilization takes place. The main hormone during the luteal phase is progesterone. Anxiety, mood fluctuations, headache, weight gain, and increased hunger are common premenstrual symptoms. Cyclic changes in progesterone and estrogen, excess prostaglandins, and fluctuations in serotonin levels are all responsible for premenstrual symptoms. About 80 percent of women experience premenstrual symptoms. As long as these symptoms do not disrupt everyday life, there is nothing to be concerned about.",All,Both,"Mood, PMS, Emotions",None
1,F7,I have a big increase in hunger before my period. Is that normal?,"Increased hunger, anxiety, mood fluctuations, headache, and weight gain are all common premenstrual symptoms.

As long as these symptoms do not disrupt everyday life, there is nothing to be concerned about.",All,Both,"Hunger, PMS",None
1,F7,Why is my period blood black?,"It is absolutely normal for period blood to be black or dark brown at the very beginning or at the end of a period. At the beginning and end of menstruation, the flow is usually slow, and blood on the pad or tampon is old blood that has been exposed to oxygen. Menstrual discharge consists mostly of parts of the inner lining of the uterus — the inner lining of the uterine wall — and blood. It moves from the uterus to the vagina, where it is oxidized. Blood contains iron, which becomes black after oxidation. However, if menstrual blood is black throughout the whole period, it could indicate a problem. Be sure to contact a health care provider in this case.",All,Both,"Bleeding, Color, Health",None
1,F7,Can antibiotics affect your period?,"Antibiotics do not cause late, early, or absent periods or heavy and prolonged menstruation. The most likely cause for an irregular period on antibiotics is usually the infection for which an antibiotic was prescribed.

However, taking placebo pills during the first 10 days of the pack can lead to heavy and prolonged periods. It’s better to consult a health care provider before making a switch. Some people claim that vitamin C, ginger, parsley, turmeric, or other herbs can induce periods. However, there is no reliable scientific evidence that they work.",All,Both,"Home Remedies, Health",None
1,F7,I’m bleeding after taking the morning-after pill. Is it my period?,"The morning-after pill is a form of emergency contraception. It contains levonorgestrel, which is a synthetic form of the hormone progesterone. There is another type of emergency contraception that contains ulipristal acetate. The morning-after pill may cause unexpected uterine bleeding that should end before the next normal period starts. Emergency contraception pills can also cause the next period to come late or early or be heavier and more painful. The morning-after pill should not be used as a routine method of birth control.",All,Both,"Birth Control, Bleeding",None
1,F7,Is it ok to feel different depending on the day of the cycle?,"The menstrual cycle can affect people’s emotional and physical condition.

It can also contain extra underwear in case of spotting, hand sanitizer, wipes, and two to three small plastic bags.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Preparation",None
1,F8,Why has my menstrual flow reduced?,"A decrease in menstrual flow can have various underlying causes. In Eastern medicine, this change may be associated with imbalances in your body's energy, known as Qi. Several factors can contribute to reduced menstrual flow, including stress, hormonal fluctuations, nutritional deficiencies, excessive exercise, or changes in weight. A low-calorie diet and over exercise can also contribute to a reduction in menstrual flow. When the body is not receiving enough calories or nutrients, it can enter a state of energy conservation, impacting hormonal balance and the menstrual cycle. Insufficient calorie intake and excessive exercise can disrupt the production of reproductive hormones, leading to irregular or absent periods, known as amenorrhea. This can occur due to the body's prioritization of vital functions over reproductive processes. Additionally, certain health conditions, such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders, may also affect your menstrual flow. If you're concerned about the reduction in your menstrual flow, it's advisable to consult with a healthcare provider or a qualified Eastern medicine practitioner who can assess your specific situation and provide personalized guidance for restoring balance and supporting a healthy menstrual cycle. ",All,Both,"Flow, Irregularity",None
1,F8,Can your menstrual cycle affect your mental health?,"Certainly! The fluctuation of two key hormones—estrogen and progesterone—during your menstrual cycle can influence your mental health. In the first half of your cycle, estrogen levels rise, which can contribute to feelings of vitality and emotional balance. However, during the second half, both estrogen and progesterone levels drop, potentially leading to mood changes, irritability, or even symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). These hormonal shifts affect neurotransmitters like serotonin, impacting mood regulation. Practicing self-care, maintaining a healthy lifestyle, and seeking support from loved ones can help alleviate these effects and promote emotional well-being.",All,Both,"Mood, PMS, Emotions",None
1,F8,Can periods be late?,"Periods can be late for various reasons, and natural variations in cycle length are common, even for those with regular cycles. It's worth noting that the egg for a given period was created three months earlier, so when evaluating causes, consider events over the past three months rather than just the last few weeks. Delayed periods can result from factors such as stress, which disrupts hormonal balance and ovulation timing; hormonal imbalances linked to conditions like polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or thyroid disorders; and changes in weight, where significant loss, gain, excessive exercise, or restrictive diets can affect hormones and menstrual regularity. Additionally, medications or medical conditions, including hormonal contraceptives, fibroids, or reproductive disorders, may cause delays. Perimenopause can also lead to irregular or unpredictable cycles as individuals approach menopause. If sexually active, pregnancy should be considered as a potential cause. For concerns about late or irregular periods, consulting a healthcare provider is recommended for personalized assessment, testing, and appropriate care.",All,Both,"Delayed Period, Causes",None
1,F8,When is menstrual bleeding a concern?,"While menstrual bleeding varies in flow, duration, and symptoms, certain situations warrant evaluation by a healthcare provider.  Excessive bleeding , such as needing to change sanitary products every hour or passing blood clots larger than a quarter, could indicate conditions like menorrhagia, hormonal imbalances, or uterine fibroids.  Prolonged bleeding , lasting more than seven days or accompanied by spotting between periods, may signal hormonal imbalances, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or endometriosis.  Severe pain  that disrupts daily activities or requires excessive medication could point to conditions like endometriosis, adenomyosis, or pelvic inflammatory disease.  Irregular cycles , marked by unpredictable or very frequent periods or sudden changes in cycle patterns, might indicate hormonal or thyroid issues. Additionally,  unusual symptoms  such as severe nausea, vomiting, dizziness, fainting, extreme fatigue, or high fever should be promptly addressed, as they may indicate serious underlying conditions. Seeking medical advice for any concerns about menstrual bleeding ensures timely diagnosis and appropriate treatment.",All,Both,"Bleeding, Symptoms, Doctor",None
1,F8,I'm having periods every two weeks? Is that normal?,"Having periods every two weeks, known as a short menstrual cycle or frequent menstruation, is not considered normal and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. While menstrual cycles can vary in length from person to person, the average cycle is around 28 days, with some natural variation. Menstruating every two weeks can indicate an underlying hormonal imbalance, such as irregular ovulation, thyroid disorders, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), or other gynecological conditions.  It is important to consult with a healthcare provider who can assess your specific situation, take a detailed medical history, and possibly order further tests or examinations to determine the cause of the frequent periods. They can provide a proper diagnosis and develop an appropriate treatment plan to address the underlying issue and help regulate your menstrual cycle.  Remember, timely medical evaluation is crucial to identify any potential underlying health concerns and to restore a healthier menstrual cycle. ",All,Both,"Irregularity, Diagnosis",None
1,F8,How to have a healthy menstrual period?,"Maintaining a healthy menstrual period involves a holistic lifestyle approach to support overall well-being and address imbalances or discomforts. Eating a  balanced diet  rich in whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and healthy fats—especially those high in iron, calcium, magnesium, and vitamins B and D—helps maintain hormone balance.  Staying hydrated  and drinking plenty of water throughout the day is essential, along with engaging in  regular exercise  like walking, yoga, or swimming to improve circulation and reduce cramps. Managing  stress  through practices like deep breathing, meditation, or hobbies, along with ensuring  quality sleep  of 7-9 hours per night, promotes hormonal regulation.

1,F9,Will periods stop after hysterectomy?,"Yes, after a hysterectomy, menstrual periods will stop. A hysterectomy is a surgical procedure in which the uterus is removed, and in some cases, the cervix and other reproductive organs may also be removed. Since the uterus is responsible for shedding the uterine lining during menstruation, its removal eliminates the source of menstrual bleeding. Therefore, after a hysterectomy, you will no longer have menstrual periods.  It's important to note that if the ovaries are not removed during the hysterectomy (a procedure called oophorectomy), hormonal cycles and hormone production will generally continue. However, without a uterus, there will be no menstrual bleeding. If both the uterus and ovaries are removed (total hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy), hormonal changes will occur due to the loss of ovarian function, which may have different effects on your body and overall well-being.  It is recommended to have a detailed discussion with your healthcare provider before undergoing a hysterectomy to fully understand the potential effects and implications for your menstrual cycle and overall health.",All,Both,"Surgery, Reproductive Health",None
1,F9,Can periods restart after menopause?,"No, periods do not typically restart after menopause. Menopause is defined as the permanent cessation of menstrual periods, marking the end of reproductive years. Once a person has reached menopause, which is usually confirmed after 12 consecutive months without a period, the ovaries stop releasing eggs, hormone levels change, and menstrual cycles come to an end.  However, it's important to note that there is a transitional phase leading up to menopause called perimenopause. During this time, menstrual cycles may become irregular, with skipped periods, longer or shorter cycles, or changes in flow. Perimenopause can last several years before reaching menopause.  If a person experiences vaginal bleeding or spotting after going through menopause, it is considered abnormal and should be evaluated by a healthcare provider. Post-menopausal bleeding can indicate various underlying conditions, such as hormonal imbalances, endometrial atrophy, polyps, or even certain types of cancer. It's important to seek medical advice to determine the cause and receive appropriate treatment if needed.  Remember, if you have concerns about changes in your menstrual cycle or any post-menopausal bleeding, it's always best to consult with a healthcare provider for a proper evaluation and guidance.

1,F9,What Are Natural Remedies for Menopause Symptoms?,"Natural remedies can be effective in managing menopause symptoms. Herbal supplements like black cohosh, evening primrose oil, and red clover have been reported to alleviate hot flashes and night sweats. It is also important to maintain a good iodine level during this time, so supplementing with plant based iodine is also helpful if you are low. Maintaining a balanced diet rich in whole foods, staying hydrated, and reducing caffeine and alcohol intake can also help. Mind-body practices such as yoga, meditation, and deep breathing can assist in managing stress and promoting emotional well-being. However, it's essential to consult a healthcare provider before starting any new supplements or remedies, especially if you have underlying health conditions.",Old Adults,Both,"Remedies, Wellness",None
1,F9,How Does Menopause Impact Mental Health?,"Menopause can indeed impact mental health due to hormonal fluctuations and other physiological changes.

1,F9,How Long Do Menopause Symptoms Last?,"The duration of menopause symptoms varies among individuals. Some women may experience symptoms for only a few months, while others might face them for several years. On average, most symptoms tend to gradually decrease within a few years after the onset of menopause. Hot flashes and night sweats, for instance, may diminish in frequency and intensity. It's important to note that while symptoms may lessen, it's also possible to experience occasional discomfort even after the transition is complete.",Old Adults,Both,"Duration, Symptoms",None
1,F9,Can I Get Pregnant During Perimenopause?,"Yes, pregnancy is still possible during perimenopause, although fertility decreases. Perimenopause is the transitional phase leading up to menopause, and ovulation can still occur sporadically. If you wish to avoid pregnancy, it's crucial to continue using contraception until you've reached menopause (defined as no periods for 12 consecutive months).

1,F10,How do pads work?,"Pads, also known as sanitary pads or menstrual pads, are designed to absorb menstrual blood during a person's period. They typically consist of a soft, absorbent core, a moisture barrier layer, and an adhesive backing to keep the pad in place within underwear. The core of the pad is made of materials such as wood pulp, cotton, or synthetic fibers that can absorb and hold the menstrual flow. The moisture barrier layer helps prevent leakage, and the pad's shape and wings (if present) provide added protection and secure fit. When worn, the pad absorbs menstrual blood, drawing it into the absorbent core and away from the body. The pad helps keep the wearer dry and comfortable while providing protection against leaks. Pads should be changed regularly to maintain hygiene and prevent odor.",All,Both,"Products, Hygiene",None
1,F10,How are single-use pads made?,"The manufacturing process of pads involves a mix of automated machinery and manual labor, varying slightly among brands and types. It typically includes the following steps:  Material Preparation , where raw materials like wood pulp, cotton, or synthetic fibers are processed and treated to enhance absorbency;  Core Formation , where these materials are layered and bonded to create the absorbent core;  Top Sheet and Back Sheet  application, involving a soft, non-woven fabric as the top sheet for comfort and a moisture barrier layer, usually plastic, as the back sheet to prevent leakage;  Shape and Design , where pads are cut into the desired shape, such as rectangular or contoured, with optional wings for better stability and protection; and finally,  Packaging , where pads are individually wrapped and packaged for hygiene and user convenience.",All,Both,"Products, Manufacturing",None
1,F10,Can you use pads while swimming?,"Standard pads are not designed to be worn while swimming. When pads come into contact with water, they become saturated and lose their absorbency capabilities. Additionally, the adhesive backing may not effectively stick to the skin when wet, leading to potential shifting or discomfort.  For swimming during menstruation, alternative options are available. Menstrual cups, which are inserted into the vagina to collect menstrual flow, are a popular choice for swimming as they do not absorb water. Some individuals also opt for period-proof swimwear or special swim-friendly menstrual pads that are designed specifically for use in water. These products are made with materials that are water-resistant, quick-drying, and provide protection against leaks while swimming.  It's important to choose the menstrual product that suits your needs and preferences. If you have specific concerns or questions about using pads while swimming, it's advisable to consult the instructions provided by the manufacturer or seek guidance from healthcare professionals or trusted sources specializing in menstrual health.

1,F10,Who invented pads and when?,"The evolution of disposable menstrual pads is the result of contributions from various individuals and innovations over time. In ancient times, materials like papyrus were used by Egyptians as absorbents. During the late 18th century, Benjamin Franklin and Dr. Benjamin Joseph Smith proposed designs for absorbent pads, though these were not widely adopted. In the late 19th century, Johnson & Johnson introduced  Lister's Towels , the first commercial disposable sanitary napkins in the United States, made of cotton wool. The early 20th century saw Kimberly-Clark revolutionizing menstrual hygiene with the launch of  Kotex  in 1921, the first mass-produced disposable pads. Modern pads evolved further with the addition of features like adhesive strips, wings, and thinner designs for improved comfort and leak prevention. Across history and cultures, various materials and methods were used for menstrual management, and the development of contemporary pads reflects the contributions of inventors, companies, and advancements in materials and technology. For a deeper dive into this history, historical records and archives on women's health provide a wealth of information.",All,Both,"History, Products",None
1,F10,How do I know what size pad I need?,"Choosing the right size of pads, whether disposable or reusable, involves several considerations to ensure comfort and adequate protection. Menstrual flow is a key factor; those with heavier flow may need larger pads with higher absorbency, while lighter flows can often be managed with smaller pads or panty liners. Pad length and coverage are also important—longer pads provide more coverage and are ideal for heavy flow or extra protection, while shorter pads suit lighter days or the end of a period. Your body shape and comfort should guide your choice, ensuring the pad fits well and provides coverage for your underwear. Pads with wings can offer added security and prevent leaks. For reusable pads, factors like length, width, and absorbent layers are crucial to meet your needs while offering the advantage of being washable and eco-friendly. Trying different options and observing how well they work can help you find the best fit and absorbency level. Many manufacturers provide size guidelines on packaging or websites, which can be useful references. Ultimately, the right pad is one that aligns with your flow, provides comfort, and keeps you confident throughout your period.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Products",None
1,F11,How do I change my pad quietly?,"To change a pad discreetly at school, consider the following tips for maintaining privacy and comfort:  Choose a quieter location , such as a less crowded or noisy restroom stall, to reduce the chance of being overheard.  Be prepared  by carrying enough pads in a small, discreet pouch to ensure easy access and discreet storage of fresh and used pads.  Practice noise control  by unwrapping pads and removing adhesive backing slowly and gently to minimize noise. For disposal,  utilize available options  such as sanitary disposal units in the restroom; if unavailable, wrap the used pad in toilet paper and discreetly place it in the trash bin. Remember, many people experience similar situations, and most are understanding about menstrual hygiene. Sharing with trusted friends can also provide support and understanding during your period. Ultimately, focus on your comfort, privacy, and well-being during menstruation.",All,Both,"Privacy, Products",None
1,F11,Are pads safer than tampons?,"Both pads and tampons are safe when used correctly and according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with the choice often depending on personal preference, comfort, and individual needs.  Safety  is assured through rigorous testing, with pads collecting menstrual flow externally and tampons absorbing it internally. When used properly, both carry a very low risk of infection or complications. In terms of  absorbency , pads and tampons are available in various levels to accommodate light to heavy flow, with tampons being a preferred choice for those comfortable with internal protection.  Comfort and convenience  play a key role, as some individuals prefer the external nature of pads, while others appreciate the discretion and freedom of movement provided by tampons, particularly during activities like swimming. For  menstrual health , tampons may be more practical in certain situations, such as overnight use or physical activities, but they must be changed regularly to minimize the risk of toxic shock syndrome (TSS). Exploring reusable and less toxic menstrual products, alongside traditional options, can provide a more sustainable and personalized solution to menstrual care. It’s essential to consider all options and make an informed choice that best suits your lifestyle and comfort.",All,Both,"Products, Safety",None
1,F11,How many pads per day is normal?,"The number of pads used per day during menstruation varies widely depending on an individual's menstrual flow and personal preferences. There is no universal ""normal,"" as flow levels differ from person to person. On average, those with a light flow may use around 2–3 pads per day, while individuals with a moderate flow may require 3–5 pads daily. For a heavy flow, more frequent changes are needed, often exceeding 5 pads per day. These estimates are approximate and influenced by factors such as flow intensity, cycle length, and individual comfort with pad changes. Everyone’s needs are unique, so the key is to change pads as needed to maintain comfort and hygiene.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Products",None
1,F11,Can you tell a girl is wearing a pad?,"It is generally not noticeable to others if a person is wearing a pad that is properly positioned and secured within their underwear. Modern pads are designed to be discreet and provide a comfortable fit. However, individual body types, clothing choices, and specific circumstances may influence how noticeable a pad might be. It is worth noting that everyone's body and experiences are unique. If you have concerns about pad visibility or discomfort, exploring different pad options, such as thinner profiles or different sizes, or considering alternative menstrual products like menstrual cups or period underwear, may provide a more comfortable and discreet solution. Remember, menstrual hygiene is a personal matter, and individuals should feel empowered to choose the products and practices that suit their needs and comfort level.",All,Both,"Privacy, Products",None
1,F11,Are thick or thin pads better?,"The choice between thick and thin pads depends on personal preference, menstrual flow intensity, and comfort.  Thick pads  generally offer higher absorbency due to additional layers of material, making them ideal for heavier flows or those seeking extra protection against leaks. However, they may feel bulky and less comfortable, especially when wearing tight-fitting clothes. On the other hand,  thin pads  are lightweight and discreet, providing a comfortable option for those with a lighter flow. Thanks to advancements in technology, many thin pads now offer reliable absorbency despite their slim profile. Ultimately, experimenting with both types can help determine which option best suits your flow and comfort needs.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Products",None
1,F11,Should I change my pad every time I go to the bathroom?,"Changing your pad every time you go to the bathroom is not strictly necessary, but it is important to change it regularly based on your flow and comfort. For a  light flow , pads can typically be changed every 4 to 6 hours to maintain freshness and comfort. For a  moderate to heavy flow , changing pads every 2 to 4 hours is recommended to prevent leaks and maintain hygiene. Regular changes help avoid moisture buildup, odor, and potential skin irritation. Finding the right balance for your individual needs, considering flow intensity and comfort, is key. If you have specific concerns about pad usage or menstrual hygiene, consulting a healthcare professional or trusted menstrual health resources can provide personalized guidance.",All,Both,"Hygiene, Products",None
1,F11,Can pads cause side effects?,"Pads are generally safe and rarely cause significant side effects when used correctly. However, some individuals may experience minor issues, such as  skin irritation , which can result from prolonged moisture or friction. Regular pad changes, good hygiene, and ensuring a proper fit can help prevent irritation.  Allergic reactions  are another possibility, particularly for those sensitive to materials, adhesives, or fragrances in some pads. Symptoms like itching, redness, or swelling can be addressed by switching to pads without allergens or opting for hypoallergenic or organic varieties. Occasionally, bacterial growth may lead to a mild  odor , which can be minimized with regular changes, proper hygiene, and pads with odor-control features.   These side effects are typically manageable, but if you experience persistent discomfort or unusual symptoms, consult a healthcare professional for advice. Exploring alternatives like organic pads, hypoallergenic options, or reusable cloth pads may be beneficial for those with sensitivities or preferences for natural materials. Ultimately, finding menstrual products that suit your needs and ensure comfort, absorbency, and compatibility with your body is key.",All,Both,"Safety, Products",None
1,F12,What are the health benefits of using a menstrual cup?,"Using a menstrual cup offers several health benefits compared to other menstrual products.  Reduced risk of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS)  is a key advantage, as cups, unlike tampons, can be safely worn for up to 12 hours without significantly increasing the risk of this rare bacterial infection. Additionally, menstrual cups are made from  non-absorbent materials  like medical-grade silicone or latex, which help maintain natural vaginal moisture, reduce irritation, and support a healthy pH balance, unlike tampons that can cause dryness. Cups are also  free from chemicals  such as dyes, fragrances, and bleaches, minimizing exposure to potential irritants. Their  longer usage time —up to 12 hours—offers greater convenience with fewer changes, reducing stress and mess. Menstrual cups are  environmentally sustainable , as they are reusable and can last several years, significantly reducing waste from disposable products. Furthermore, they are  cost-effective , with a higher upfront cost but long-term savings over years of use.  Although it may take time to adapt to using a menstrual cup, proper insertion, removal, and cleaning techniques are essential for hygiene and comfort. If you're considering a menstrual cup, consult with a healthcare provider or reliable sources to choose the right cup for your needs and to ensure safe and effective use.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Hygiene",None
1,F12,Will a menstrual cup stretch me out?,"No, using a menstrual cup will not stretch or permanently change the size or shape of your vagina. The vagina is a muscular and elastic organ that can accommodate different sizes, including the insertion and removal of menstrual cups.  Menstrual cups are typically made of soft, flexible materials like medical-grade silicone. They are designed to be inserted into the vagina, where they create a gentle seal to collect menstrual flow. When properly inserted and positioned, a menstrual cup should unfold and fit comfortably in the vaginal canal without causing any stretching or discomfort.  It's important to choose the right size and shape of menstrual cup that suits your individual needs and anatomy. Cups come in various sizes to accommodate different vaginal lengths and strengths. It's also crucial to follow the instructions for insertion, removal, and maintenance provided by the cup manufacturer.  If you have any concerns or discomfort while using a menstrual cup, it's recommended to consult with a healthcare provider or seek advice from a trusted source for guidance. They can provide personalized assistance and address any specific concerns you may have.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Safety",None
1,F12,How Long Do Menstrual Cups Last?,"The longevity of a menstrual cup largely depends on how well it's cared for and the quality of the materials. Generally, a high-quality menstrual cup can last anywhere from 1 to 10 years. Regular cleaning, proper storage, and gentle handling are key factors in prolonging its lifespan. Over time, you might notice slight changes in color or texture, which is normal and doesn't necessarily affect the cup's performance. If you notice any significant deterioration, such as cracking or changes in shape, it's time to consider replacing your cup to ensure optimal comfort and safety.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Products",None
1,F12,Can You Use a Menstrual Cup if I'm a Virgin?,"Absolutely, yes! Being a virgin doesn't affect your ability to use a menstrual cup. The concept of virginity is related to sexual activity, and using a menstrual cup doesn't impact that. Menstrual cups are designed to provide comfortable and reliable period protection for individuals of all ages and sexual experiences. If you're new to using cups, it might take a little practice to find the right insertion technique, but there's no reason why you can't use them, regardless of your virginity status.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Safety",None
1,F12,Can I Use a Menstrual Cup if I Have a Heavy Flow?,"Yes, menstrual cups are suitable for individuals with heavy flows! One of the benefits of menstrual cups is their higher capacity compared to tampons and pads. Most cups can hold more menstrual fluid, which can be particularly advantageous for those with heavier flows. You might need to empty the cup more frequently during the heaviest days of your period, but the increased capacity can provide longer-lasting protection and reduce the need for constant changes.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Heavy Flow",None
1,F12,Can a Menstrual Cup Get Lost Inside You?,"No, a menstrual cup cannot get lost inside your body. The cervix at the top of the vagina serves as a natural barrier, preventing the cup from traveling into the uterus. While cups can move higher or lower within the vaginal canal, they are always easily retrievable by gently bearing down with your pelvic muscles and reaching for the base of the cup. If you're having difficulty removing the cup, try relaxing and using a pinch-and-release technique to break the seal before pulling it out.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Safety",None
1,F12,Can You Exercise with a Menstrual Cup?,"Absolutely! Menstrual cups are fantastic for active individuals. Whether you're into jogging, yoga, swimming, or any other physical activity, a properly inserted and sealed menstrual cup should stay in place and provide leak-free protection.

Just remember to ensure a proper seal when inserting the cup and to empty and clean it as needed after your workout.",All,Both,"Menstrual Cup, Activity",None
1,F13,Can periods make you throw up?,"Definitely! So, here's the scoop. While it's not super common, some individuals might experience a bit of queasiness or even vomiting during their periods. It's not the most pleasant thing to deal with, but rest assured, you're not alone. Hormonal changes during your menstrual cycle can sometimes upset your stomach, causing nausea. Now, let's be clear, not everyone will go through this, and most people won't experience vomiting during their periods. But if you find yourself feeling nauseous, there are a few things you can try. Eating smaller, more frequent meals can help keep your stomach settled. Avoiding foods or smells that trigger nausea, like greasy foods or strong perfumes, might help too. And don't forget to take some time to relax and destress. Stress can worsen those tummy troubles.",All,Both,"Symptoms, Health Concerns",None
1,F13,Can periods cause dizziness?,"Periods can indeed cause dizziness for some individuals due to several factors.  Hormonal changes  during the menstrual cycle, particularly fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, can impact blood vessels and blood pressure, leading to dizziness or lightheadedness.  Blood loss  during menstruation can temporarily lower blood volume, especially with heavy or prolonged periods, contributing to these symptoms. Additionally,  anemia  from chronic heavy bleeding may result in iron deficiency, causing dizziness, fatigue, and weakness due to insufficient oxygen transport in the blood.  Menstrual cramps , particularly intense ones, can also indirectly contribute to feeling lightheaded due to pain and discomfort. If dizziness is severe or disrupts your daily life, consulting a healthcare provider is essential to evaluate underlying conditions and explore treatment options. In the meantime, practicing self-care by staying hydrated, managing cramps, and ensuring adequate iron intake through diet or supplements (if recommended) can help alleviate symptoms.

1,F14,Can periods cause constipation?,"Periods can indeed cause constipation, and while it's not pleasant, it's a common experience for many.  Hormonal changes  during the menstrual cycle, particularly fluctuations in estrogen and progesterone, can slow down bowel movements by affecting the smooth muscle contractions in the intestines.  Water retention  and bloating during periods may also interfere with stool regularity, contributing to constipation. Additionally,  pain medications  like NSAIDs taken for menstrual cramps can have constipation as a side effect. Changes in eating habits during your period, such as indulging in cravings and consuming fewer fiber-rich foods, can further exacerbate the issue.  To manage period-related constipation, try staying  hydrated  by drinking plenty of water, incorporating  fiber-rich foods  like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and legumes into your meals, and engaging in  gentle exercise  such as walking or stretching to stimulate digestion. Practicing  relaxation techniques  like deep breathing or yoga can also help by reducing stress, which can impact digestion.

2,D58,Why did my periods stop during pregnancy?," Each month, your body goes through a cycle of changes to prepare for a potential 
 pregnancy. If you don’t become pregnant, your cycle ends and the lining of your uterus 
 (womb) sheds — this blood is your period. 
 But if you do become pregnant, your body retains the lining of your uterus. That’s why you 
 stop getting periods during pregnancy.",Young Adults,Both,"pregnancy, period",Gemini
2,D58,Can I bleed during pregnancy?,"Even though your periods stop, you can still experience bleeding during pregnancy. 
 This happens in almost 1 in 4 women for different reasons. 
 Many women who bleed during pregnancy go on to deliver a healthy baby. However, you 
 should immediately contact your doctor or midwife if you notice bleeding from your vagina 
 at any time during your pregnancy. 
 In early pregnancy, the fertilised egg implanting itself in your womb may cause bleeding. This 
 is known as implantation bleeding. It normally only lasts for a few days. 
 Bleeding during early pregnancy can sometimes signal a problem with the pregnancy. It can 
 be a sign that the fertilised egg has implanted itself outside the uterus — this is called an 
 ectopic pregnancy. It could also signal a miscarriage. 
 In the later stages of pregnancy, vaginal bleeding can have many different causes. ",Young Adults,Both,"pregnancy, bleeding",Gemini
2,D58,What can I expect after the birth?," In the first few days after birth, it’s normal to have some period-like bleeding. This 
 happens as your uterus contracts back to the size it was before pregnancy. 
 Bleeding immediately after birth can be fairly heavy. It can also be bright red for the first 
 couple of days, but gradually becomes a brownish colour before it stops after about 2 
 months. 
 Bleeding might be heavier in the morning when you get up, after breastfeeding or after 
 exercise. 
 Uncontrolled heavy bleeding after birth, called a postpartum haemorrhage, can be a serious 
 concern. 
 If you've given birth more than 24 hours ago, contact your doctor or midwife immediately if 
 you notice: 
 • blood that soaks more than one pad every 1 to 2 hours 
 • a sudden increase in blood or large clots 
 • blood which suddenly turns bright red in colour

 periods to return as soon as 4 to 6 weeks after childbirth.

 than if you exclusively breastfeed. 
 If you choose to breastfeed exclusively, your first period may not return for several months. 
 For those who keep breastfeeding, it might not return for 1 to 2 years. 
 There is no way to know if your periods will return the same way they were before you were 
 pregnant. If you experience a different kind of period pain or your periods have changed,
